            <p>These are an assortment of simple practice games, mostly cobbled together in ct.js, to replace the games from the "Garden of Dreams", which used to be available at the Institute of Noetic Sciences.</p>
            <p>Individual game links go to various locations on itch.io, and should open in a separate tab or window (depending on your broswer of choice).</p>

            <p>The <a href="circles.html" target="_break">Circle games</a> all involve circles or "balls." Some are moving around the field of play, and some are falling.</p>
            <p>The <a href="sheep.html"target="_break" >Sheep</a> ones are based on the same code, but using animations I'd made for a different game, because some people find it easier to think in terms of 'herding' the sheep.</p>
            <p>Here again, the <a href="fish.html" target="_break">Fish</a> games use animated animals as the 'randomly moving objects.' In one, you're trying to push towards a chosen direction (similar to the Bell-Curve game at the <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/" target="_break">RetroPsychokinesis Project</a>); and in the other, you're trying to move the fish toward the water lily pad.</p>
            <p>Speaking of the <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/" target="_break">RetroPsychokinesis Project</a>, yes, the site is still active. In addition to a number of tests to try, there are links to a nice assortment of documentation. Don't let the "designed in the 1990s" aesthetic of the site fool you. It's still excellent. And, it <i>was</i> put online in the mid-90s, after all.</p>
