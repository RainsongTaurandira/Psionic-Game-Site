            <p>The Dowsing games are a couple of small map-dowsing things, based loosely on one of the "Stargate" documents in the handy-dandy CIA library. There is a grid on a map, and an x will appear somewhere in one of the squares. Your task to to map-dowse on a paper with the same grid (8x5) and predict which cell the x will appear in.</p>
            <p>In <a href="https://rainsong.itch.io/map-dowsing-game" target="_break">Map-Dowsing 1</a>, the X is generated at the same time as the page, so the dowsing is meant to be done before opening it.</p>
            <p>In <a href="https://rainsong.itch.io/map-dowsing-game-2" target="_break">Map-Dowsing 2</a>, the X is generated after the page is, and you press a button to call forth the X. The dowsing can be done ahead of time, or while the page is open, before pressing the button.</p>
