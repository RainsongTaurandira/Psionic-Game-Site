            <p>These are an assortment of simple practice games, mostly cobbled together in ct.js, to replace the games from the "Garden of Dreams", which used to be available at the Institute of Noetic Sciences.</p>
            <p>Individual game links go to various locations on itch.io, and should open in a separate tab or window (depending on your broswer of choice).</p>

        <div class="home-content">
            <p>The <a href="dowsing.html" target="_break">Dowsing games</a> are a couple of small map-dowsing things, based loosely on one of the "Stargate" documents in the handy-dandy CIA library. There is a grid on a map, and an x will appear somewhere in one of the squares. Your task to to map-dowse on a paper with the same grid (8x5) and predict which cell the x will appear in.</p>
            <p>The <a href="ideogram.html" target="_break">Ideogram</a> one is for drilling basic ideograms. Might be a bit of a stretch to call this a 'game', really. But if you are in the "ideograms should be drilled" camp, fill your boots.</p>
            <p>For the moment, there is one <a href="precog.html" target="_break">Precog</a> piece in here: it's a collection of simple dice and card bots.</p>
            <p>Under construction, to be added "soon", is a password-protected section that will include some casino-like games: slots, baccarat, and so on. (The slots and simplified baccarat games are ready - the site is not.) No bets will be placed, and no money will be involved. The password protection serves two purposes: primarily, to make it less likely someone will accidentally open that section if it's not a good spot for them to be in; and, secondarily, as a password-authentication demonstration.</p>
