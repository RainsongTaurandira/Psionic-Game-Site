            <p><a href="https://rainsong.itch.io/sheep-herding-game" target="_break">Sheep!</a> is a top-down view of frantic randomly moving cartoon sheep. It's the same principle as the Circle games: use PK to determine their movement. Group them together in a herd, or arrange them in a circle, or whatever.</p>
            <p>For comparison purposes, <a href="https://rainsong.itch.io/sheep-herding-game-2" target="_break">Sheep! 2</a> is the same sheep-herding game with the sheep seen in side view. It's a PK game: use your mind to herd the sheep. It might help to pretend to be a sheepdog in the scene. Or to talk to the sheep. Enjoy. (The sheep animations are from the Sheepy game, and don't worry: I made them, and the Sheepy license was non-exclusive. No copyright problems here.)</p>
