            <p>For the moment, there is one <a href="https://rainsong.itch.io/dicebot-and-card-guessing" target="_break" >Precog</a> piece in here: it's a collection of simple dice and card bots. The objective is pretty self-explanatory: predict what will come up.</p>
            <p>Under construction, to be added "soon", is a password-protected section that will include some casino-like games: slots, baccarat, and so on. (The slots and simplified baccarat games are ready - the site is not.) No bets will be placed, and no money will be involved. The password protection serves two purposes: primarily, to make it less likely someone will accidentally open that section if it's not a good spot for them to be in; and, secondarily, as a password-authentication demonstration.</p>
