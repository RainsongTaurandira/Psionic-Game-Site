            <p>Here again, the Fish games use animated animals as the 'randomly moving objects.' In one, you're trying to push towards a chosen direction (similar to the Bell-Curve game at the <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/" target="_break">RetroPsychokinesis Project</a>); and in the other, you're trying to move the fish toward the water lily pad.</p>
            <p>In the <a href="https://rainsong.itch.io/fishhhhhh" target="_break">first one,</a> lily-pad will be pseudo-randomly placed in the field of play, and then little animated carp will start appearing (instead of dots). Gather the carp together near the lily-pad.</p>
            <p>In the <a href="https://rainsong.itch.io/fishhhhh-2" target="_break">second one,</a> By request, this version has single-axis pseudo-random movement, instead of movement all over the screen. A fish starts out in the middle of the screen. In the X-axis level, you attempt to move him either to the left or right. In the Y-axis level, you attempt to move him up or down. The score changes each time the fish hits the edge of the screen (down by one point in one direction, and up in the other). Get as far from 0 as possible, in either direction. The lily-pads are strictly decorative in this game.</p>
